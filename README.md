The Word Ladder Solver program with three search algorithmsâ€”Uniform Cost Search (UCS), Greedy Best First Search (GBFS), and A* Search to find the shortest path between two words by changing one letter at a time. UCS looks for paths with the lowest cumulative cost, GBFS prioritizes nodes based on heuristic values alone, and A* combines actual costs with heuristics for optimal pathfinding.
